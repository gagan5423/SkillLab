Jenkins CI/CD:

Task : Create a CI/CD pipeline to automate code deployment from GitHub

We implemented a Jenkins pipeline that automatically builds and deploys an application from a GitHub repository to a Tomcat server. This pipeline eliminates the need for manual builds by triggering automatically whenever changes are pushed to the repository. As a result, it streamlines the deployment process and significantly reduces manual effort.
